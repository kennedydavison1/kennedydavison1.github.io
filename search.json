    "section": "",
    "text": "After winning the Constructors’ Championship in 2024 with Lando Norris finishing second and Oscar Piastri close behind in fourth, both drivers have continued to dominate for McLaren in the 2025 season. At the start of the year, Piastri led the Drivers’ Championship until the Mexico City Grand Prix. Now, Norris sits in first place with Piastri closely behind. After a season full of wins and podiums, the question becomes whether Piastri’s fall from first is due to a dip in performance or because of McLaren’s strategic choices.\nComparing Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri across the four series in which both drivers have competed provides a clearer idea of how their careers stack up. When their wins, podiums, and retirements are viewed side by side, the series appear a lot more comparable even with Norris having more years in racing than Piastri. Even though he has spent less time in these series, Piastri has nearly matched his win count with 30 to Norris’s 34. This raises the question of whether Piastri is the stronger driver or simply has had fewer opportunities for poor results.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlandof1 &lt;- read_csv(\"project data/landoF1.csv\") |&gt; mutate(driver = \"Lando Norris\", series = \"F1\") \nlandof1summary &lt;- read_csv(\"project data/landoF1summary.csv\")|&gt; mutate(driver = \"Lando Norris\", series = \"F1\") \nlandof2 &lt;- read_csv(\"project data/landoF2.csv\") |&gt; mutate(driver = \"Lando Norris\", series = \"F2\")\nlandof2summary &lt;- read_csv(\"project data/landoF2summary.csv\")|&gt; mutate(driver = \"Lando Norris\", series = \"F2\")\nlandof3 &lt;- read_csv(\"project data/landoF3.csv\") |&gt; mutate(driver = \"Lando Norris\", series = \"F3\")\nlandof3summary &lt;- read_csv(\"project data/landoF3summary.csv\")|&gt; mutate(driver = \"Lando Norris\", series = \"F3\")\nlandof4 &lt;- read_csv(\"project data/landoF4.csv\") |&gt; mutate(driver = \"Lando Norris\", series = \"F4\")\nlandof4summary &lt;- read_csv(\"project data/landoF4summary.csv\")|&gt; mutate(driver = \"Lando Norris\", series = \"F4\")\nlandorenault &lt;- read_csv(\"project data/lando_renault.csv\") |&gt; mutate(driver = \"Lando Norris\", series = \"Renault\")\nlandorenaultsummary &lt;- read_csv(\"project data/landorenaultsummary.csv\")|&gt; mutate(driver = \"Lando Norris\", series = \"Renault\")\noscarf1 &lt;- read_csv(\"project data/oscarF1.csv\") |&gt; mutate(driver = \"Oscar Piastri\", series = \"F1\") \noscarf1summary &lt;- read_csv(\"project data/oscarF1summary.csv\")|&gt; mutate(driver = \"Oscar Piastri\", series = \"F1\")\noscarf2 &lt;- read_csv(\"project data/oscarF2.csv\") |&gt; mutate(driver = \"Oscar Piastri\", series = \"F2\")\noscarf2summary &lt;- read_csv(\"project data/oscarF2summary.csv\")|&gt; mutate(driver = \"Oscar Piastri\", series = \"F2\")\noscarf3 &lt;- read_csv(\"project data/oscarF3.csv\") |&gt; mutate(driver = \"Oscar Piastri\", series = \"F3\")\noscarf3summary &lt;- read_csv(\"project data/oscarF3summary.csv\")|&gt; mutate(driver = \"Oscar Piastri\", series = \"F3\")\noscarf4 &lt;- read_csv(\"project data/oscarF4.csv\") |&gt; mutate(driver = \"Oscar Piastri\", series = \"F4\")\noscarf4summary &lt;- read_csv(\"project data/oscarF4summary.csv\")|&gt; mutate(driver = \"Oscar Piastri\", series = \"F4\")\noscarrenault &lt;- read_csv(\"project data/oscar_renault.csv\") |&gt; mutate(driver = \"Oscar Piastri\", series = \"Renault\")\noscarrenaultsummary &lt;- read_csv(\"project data/oscarrenaultsummary.csv\")|&gt; mutate(driver = \"Oscar Piastri\", series = \"Renault\")\nf1 &lt;- bind_rows(landof1, oscarf1) \nf1summary &lt;- bind_rows(landof1summary, oscarf1summary)\nf2 &lt;- bind_rows(landof2, oscarf2)\nf2summary &lt;- bind_rows(landof2summary, oscarf2summary)\nf3 &lt;- bind_rows(landof3, oscarf3)\nf3summary &lt;- bind_rows(landof3summary, oscarf3summary)\nf4 &lt;- bind_rows(landof4, oscarf4)\nf4summary &lt;- bind_rows(landof4summary, oscarf4summary)\nrenault &lt;- bind_rows(landorenault, oscarrenault)\nrenaultsummary &lt;- bind_rows(landorenaultsummary, oscarrenaultsummary)\nlandocareer &lt;- bind_rows(landof1, landof2, landof3, landof4, landorenault)\noscarcareer &lt;- bind_rows(oscarf1, oscarf2, oscarf3, oscarf4, oscarrenault)\nsummary &lt;- bind_rows(f1summary, f2summary, f3summary, f4summary, renaultsummary)\nf12025 &lt;- f1 |&gt; filter(YEAR == \"2025\") |&gt; select(SEQ,YEAR, EVENT,`GRID POS`, RESULT, driver )\n\nlandowaffle &lt;- c(\"Wins\"=34, \"Podiums\"=64, \"Retirements\" = 22) \noscarwaffle &lt;- c(\"Wins\"=30, \"Podiums\"=40, \"Retirements\" = 12, 38) \niron(\n waffle(\n   landowaffle, \n   rows = 10, \n   colors = c(\"#D2FF00\", \"black\", \"grey\")) + \n   labs(\n     x=\"Lando Norris Career\",\n     title=\"Norris leads in wins because of more races\", \n     subtitle=\"Even with Norris being in racing longer, Piastri has almost as many wins.\") + \n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n  ),\n waffle(\n   oscarwaffle, \n   rows = 10, \n   colors = c(\"#17CCFF\", \"black\", \"grey\", \"white\")) + \n   labs(\n     x = \"Oscar Piastri Career\\n1 square = 1 race\",\n     caption=\"Data as of Nov. 10. \\n Source: Motorsport Stats \\n Graphic by Kennedy Davison\"\n     )\n) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince both drivers were in each series for different amounts of time, it is more accurate to look at their average finish and average points per race to compare them. In FIA Formula F3, Formula 4 British Championship and Formula Renault 2.0 Euro Norris had significantly more points per race than Piastri. However, in FIA Formula One and FIA Formula 2 Piastri earned more points per race with harder competition and faster cars. Essentially, Piastri competes better in faster cars with harder competition.\n\n\nCode\nsummary |&gt; \n  filter(Year == \"Total\") |&gt; \n  select(series,driver,RS, P, AF) |&gt; \n  mutate(PPR = round(P/RS, 1)) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    driver = \"Driver\", \n    P = \"Total Points\",\n    series = \"Series\",\n    AF = \"Average Finish\",\n    RS = \"Total Races\",\n    PPR = \"Points Per Race\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Norris leads in points per race until F2 where Piastri pulls ahead\",\n    subtitle = \"Norris dominated the early series but Piastri overtook him starting in F2.\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"Data as of Nov. 10. | **By:** Kennedy Davison  |  **Source:** Motorsport Stats\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#D2FF00\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = driver == \"Lando Norris\" & series == \"Renault\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#D2FF00\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = driver == \"Lando Norris\" & series == \"F4\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#D2FF00\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = driver == \"Lando Norris\" & series == \"F3\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#17CCFF\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = driver == \"Oscar Piastri\" & series == \"F2\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#17CCFF\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = driver == \"Oscar Piastri\" & series == \"F1\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorris leads in points per race until F2 where Piastri pulls ahead\n\n\nNorris dominated the early series but Piastri overtook him starting in F2.\n\n\nSeries\nDriver\nTotal Races\nTotal Points\nAverage Finish\nPoints Per Race\n\n\n\n\nF1\nLando Norris\n149\n1397.0\n6.54\n9.4\n\n\nF1\nOscar Piastri\n67\n755.0\n5.76\n11.3\n\n\nF2\nLando Norris\n26\n219.0\n5.22\n8.4\n\n\nF2\nOscar Piastri\n23\n252.5\n4.57\n11.0\n\n\nF3\nLando Norris\n33\n441.0\n4.83\n13.4\n\n\nF3\nOscar Piastri\n18\n164.0\n4.75\n9.1\n\n\nF4\nLando Norris\n30\n413.0\n4.61\n13.8\n\n\nF4\nOscar Piastri\n30\n376.5\n3.89\n12.6\n\n\nRenault\nLando Norris\n15\n253.0\n4.00\n16.9\n\n\nRenault\nOscar Piastri\n39\n430.0\n5.82\n11.0\n\n\n\nData as of Nov. 10. | By: Kennedy Davison | Source: Motorsport Stats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo how does their past racing history compare to this season? Piastri’s races show smaller gaps between where he starts and where he finishes, which shows a more predictable performance. Where Norris has more variability and more races where he drops back significantly from his starting position. The recent switch in championship points is not necessarily the result of Piastri underperforming, instead, it appears to be influenced by McLaren’s decision to keep Norris ahead once it became clear that Piastri can hold his position more consistently. So, the team’s strategy seems to be prioritizing keeping Norris ahead because of his inconsistent high-reward results while disregarding Piastri’s individual performance in the drivers championship to secure points for the constructors championship.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=f12025, \n    aes(y=reorder(EVENT,-SEQ), x=`GRID POS`, xend=RESULT),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"black\",\n    colour_xend = \"#FF8000\") + \n  facet_grid(~driver) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Position\", \n    y=\"\", \n    title=\"Piastri has been more consistent this season\", \n    subtitle=\"Piastri has led in points this season until the last few races where suddenly Norris has pulled ahead. \\nThe black point is where each driver started the race and the papaya point is where they finished the race. \", \n    caption=\"Data as of Nov. 10. | By Kennedy Davison  |  Source: Motorsport Stats\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll this to show, if Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri where to compete head to head, it is more likely Piastri would have better results. While it makes sense for McLaren’s strategy to keep Norris ahead and Piastri close behind for the Constructors Championship, now that it is already won the drivers should be able to compete within themselves."
